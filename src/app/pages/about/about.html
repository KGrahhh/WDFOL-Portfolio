      <p class="about-description">
        My name is Khristian Carl J. Pradilla and I am a 21-year-old web development student who resides in Angeles City Pampanga. My career in technology development operates through two main forces which express my artistic skills and my logical reasoning abilities. My front-end development work focuses on creating clean designs which maintain responsive capabilities while delivering visually appealing user interfaces. I design websites with neon colors and minimalist design elements because I want to create user experiences which users find easy to navigate. My free time gets divided between two activities which involve coding and playing video games. Gaming exists as my main hobby because it has improved my ability to think strategically while solving difficult problems under pressure which I use in all my development work. My time gets dedicated to researching new design styles since I need to improve my creative abilities to follow the rapid changes in my industry.
